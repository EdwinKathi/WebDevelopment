    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <h5 style="font-weight: lighter">
      As a software developer at SAGE IT, I apply my skills in Python, Java, and
      Golang to create high-quality solutions that streamline backend processes,
      enhance system scalability, and improve user experience. I have
      participated in developing REST APIs, engineered microservices
      architecture, and written adaptive and responsive UI applications,
      contributing to a significant reduction in system response time,
      operational costs, and support tickets. I have a master's degree in
      computer science from Texas Tech University, where I also work as a
      graduate assistant at the Hospitality Services department. I am passionate
      about innovation and open to new opportunities in tech, especially in the
      areas of data, AI, and software infrastructure. I have completed multiple
      certifications in programming, data structures, and data analysis, and
      have gained experience in using Mininet and LSTM. I thrive in
      collaborative and innovative cultures, and I am eager to join a
      forward-thinking company that values continuous learning and growth.
